        <H3>Welcome</H4>
            <p>Welcome to your Authentic Series Class.  My name is _______, and I'll be leading this class for the next 60/75 minutes. </p>
            <P>Before we begin class lets take a quick look around the room and make sure everyone in the room has a view of themselves in the mirror.  You may need to stager or move your mat to the right or left just a few inches.</P>
            <br>
        <H3>Meditative/Centering Thoughts</H3>
            <p>CHILDS POSE - Let's begin in Child's pose.  That is big toes together, knees open as wide as the mat. Arms reachout in front of you, forehead to the mat.  
            <p>Gently close your eyes. Allow your breathing to relax. As you inhale through your nose, feel your abdomen expanding out.  As you exhale, allow the belly to fall between the thighs.  PAUSE</p>    
            <p>With every inhalation, consciously slow your breath, bringing awareness to the space around your nostrils. With every exhale let go of all your thoughts or any external distractions.  PAUSE</p>    
            <p>Observe the state of your mind.  Set an intention for your practice today.  Maybe its a commitment to priortize the breathwork over the postures. Make a resolution to practice this intention on your yoga mat today and through the rest of your day.</p>
            <p>Continue taking deep belly breaths in through the nose, and out through the mouth.  Work with the body you have brought to the mat today. Let go of all your responsibilities, tasks and to-do lists,  as you find this deeper state of inner over the next 60 minutes.  PAUSE</p>
            <p>Become softer…soften your shoulders… jaw… face and allow your tounge to fall to the roof of your mouth.   Let's move into our Ujayi breathing, close the mouth and breathing in and out through the nose.</p>
            <p>On your next inhale, lets move into tabletop position.</p>
