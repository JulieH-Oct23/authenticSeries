        <H3>Centering Thoughts</H3>
            <p>OPENING 1 BELLY DOWN Savasana - From savasana, imagine lying in a space of our own choosing. Maybe that space is a mountain meadow, a sandy beach, or even the Boise River.  Imagine connecting to that space, the temperatures, the smell, the sounds, the way the earth feels on your skin. Know that this place is always here for you in times you feel the need to relax, recharge, or let go. </p>
            <p>Take a breath in and notice your ribs expand…take a breath out and notice how your ribs contract. Again….breathing in ribs and waist expand…breathing out ribs and waist contract.</p>
            <p> Become aware of your body as a whole….notice the outline of your skin… the weight of your body and the sense of gravity bearing down on it…..now notice the parts of your body that are in contact with the earth.  Return now to the passage of the breath flowing through you and keep an awareness of the flow of this breath as you practice.  PAUSE. </p>
            <br>
            <p>OPENING 2 CHILDS POSE - Let's begin in Child's pose.  That is big toes together, knees open as wide as the mat. Arms reachout in front of you, forehead to the mat.  Take a deep full inhale through the nose, and exale out through the mouth and you allow your bely to fall between your knees.</p>
            <p>Continue taking deep belly breaths in through the nose, and out through the mouth.  Work with the body you have brought to the mat today. Let go of all your responsibilities, tasks and to-do lists,  as you find this deeper state of inner stillness and practice over the next 60 minutes.</p>
            <p>Become softer…soften your shoulders… jaw… face and allow your tounge to fall to the roof of your mouth.   Let's move into our Ujayi breathing, close the mouth and breathing in and out through the nose.   It may sound like the ocean.</p>
            <p>On your out breath release any feelings of tension …feel a sense of a let-go…perhaps your intention for this practice can be to flow in the now… to JUST BE…here with life…on your mat…you and your practice.</p>
            <p>On your next inhale, lets move into tabletop position.</p>
