        <H3>Centering Thoughts - Landslide</H3>
        <H4>
            <p>Let's get into a comfortable seated position. Once you've found your seat, set your plan for the day aside for the next 60 minutes. </p>
            <p>Close your eyes, start to deepen your breath. Maybe start to roll your neck and shoulders.  Start to become more aware of how you feel.</p>
            <p>Lets move into our deep belly breathing, by taking three deep inhales, and exhales in through the nose and out through the nose. Becoming more aware of your breathing and heart rate.</p>
            <p>After you take your last deep belly breath, lets move into our yogic breath, Ujai breathing.  This is breathing in and out through the nose, keeping the mouth closed.  Were going to practice three  breaths together, try keep this breath throughout class as it helps to keep you cooler.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As we move into child's pose, encourage and remind yourself why you priortized this class today, and challenge yourself to give your body whatever it needs.  That might be taking more breaks today.</p>
